# Mikrotik-router-hack
This is a proof of concept of the critical WinBox vulnerability (CVE-2018-14847) which allows for arbitrary file read of plain text passwords.  The vulnerability has long since been fixed, so this project has ended and will not be supported or updated anymore. You can fork it and update it yourself instead.
